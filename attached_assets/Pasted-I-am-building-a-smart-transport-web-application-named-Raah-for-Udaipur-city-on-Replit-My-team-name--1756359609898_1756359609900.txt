I am building a smart transport web application named Raah for Udaipur city on Replit.
My team name is Pegasus (please show it in the footer and About page).

So far, I have set up a React + TailwindCSS project with a homepage that has:

Navbar with links (Home, Dashboard, Routes, Taxi Routes, About, Contact)

Hero section with city transport tagline and call-to-action button

Stats section showing buses, routes, delays, and passengers

Footer with team name Pegasus

Now, I want to integrate functional pages and features into my project:

Dashboard Page

Live charts for buses, taxi routes, passengers (use Recharts or Chart.js)

Map view of buses and taxi routes (use Leaflet or Google Maps API)

Real-time update simulation (mock API or JSON data for now)

Routes Page (Bus Routes)

Show all Udaipur bus routes in a table/grid

Search and filter routes by area/number

Option to click and view route details

Taxi Routes Page

Show all available taxi pickup/drop routes in Udaipur

Filter by area (e.g., Fatehsagar, Hiran Magri, Bapu Bazar)

Show estimated fare & travel time for each route

Option to simulate booking (button with no backend, just console log)

About Page

Info about Raah project, Udaipur smart city transport, and our Team Pegasus

Contact Page

Simple form (Name, Email, Message)

Submit button (store in mock JSON or console log for now)

Integration

Use React Router for page navigation

Keep design modern, responsive, with Tailwind

Maintain Udaipur theme colors (Royal Blue, Yellow, White)

Code must run directly in Replit without extra fixes

Please generate a complete React + Tailwind codebase with:

App.js and pages/ folder (Dashboard, Routes, TaxiRoutes, About, Contact)

components/ folder for Navbar, Footer, Cards, Forms

Routing already configured with react-router-dom

Placeholder data for buses & taxi routes

Responsive design for mobile & desktop

‚ö° With this, Gemini/Perplexity/Replit AI will give you a ready-to-run Raah project üöçüöñ.

üëâ Do you want me to also draft the taxi routes dataset (JSON with pickup, drop, fare, ETA) for Udaipur so you can plug it directly in the TaxiRoutes page?
